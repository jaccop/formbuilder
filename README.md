# formbuilder
A Vue2JS based form builder that is currently used in Autorespond.nl.

The formbuilder uses a REST API backend (Java based) to retrieve and save form and field definitions.
For this OS version I will provide a dummy node-based backend API soon.

Browserstack will help me testing the formbuilder on different platforms and browsers
